# Yoga-Pose-Detection

I have built an android application which takes picture of your yoga posture, both pre owned photos and realtime photos and it detects which posture that your photo has and its accuracy.

This Project was done using Android-Java and XML and for the detection ML Model was integrated. This model was done using CNN, the best image classifying method.
